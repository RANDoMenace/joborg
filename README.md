# JOBORG

## Description
> I needed a way to keep track of all the job applications I sent out. Seeing that their was no good sites to help me manage my searches. I decided to make my own site. This site will help with slowing down the process so you can focus on one job search at a time. Also I intended for everyone to take a real look into the companies before they submitted their awesome resumes. Stay +

# User stories
* As a user I would like to sign up with account activation and login through my email because I would feel better about security.

* As a user I would like to login straight to my user page to begin a new job query because I don't want to spend too much time navigating to the good parts.

* As a user I would like to be able to know how my resume stacks up against a current job description because I don't want to waste my time on a long shot.

* As a user I would like to be alerted if I am submitting a replicate resume to the same employer within a certain time frame because I don't want to repeat effort taken on the first attempt.
